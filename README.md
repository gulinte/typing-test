# Typing Test
Welcome to the Typing Speed Test project! This is a web application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. Users will be presented with a random passage, and their task is to type it as accurately and quickly as possible. The application will then calculate and display their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) along with their accuracy. You can try out the live demo of the Typing Speed Test project [here](https://gulinte.github.io/typing-test/)
